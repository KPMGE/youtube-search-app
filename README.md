# YouTube Search App

### Goal
This is a really simple web application with React. The aim With that is
to learn how to work with React, especially in its older versions. Because of that,
I've created the app entirely with class-based components instead of hooks.
So, this app is just a simple searcher for youtube videos. You can search a video as well as
watch it in the app.



### Final Result
The final result of the app looks like this.
